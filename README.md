I am playing an integral role in building of a Tableau Dashboard with Shannon to showcase Email responses across products, providing valuable insights, innovative ideas and leveraging strong visualization skills. The building of Pay-in-4 Emails project is a crucial activity from Collections perspective since it’s successful deployment would ensure meeting of company’s objectives in conforming to Regulatory and Compliance norms. My role in Coordination of AWS Training sessions and participation in CSR activities showcases a well-rounded involvement in both professional development and community engagement. Alongside these initiatives, I’ve maintained a consistent track record of completing trainings punctually and sustaining high office attendance, showcasing reliability and dedication to professional development and team commitment. Overall, this year has been characterized by a multifaceted engagement, demonstrating a proactive approach, a diverse skill set, and a strong commitment to both professional and community contributions. 
Business results: 
1.	A very important part of new product/process is the data discovery stage where the data quality, issues/challenges have to be understood for the data which is to be consumed for reporting/collection process. Have been involved  in deep research into the structure of all the tables created by GBP for Pay-in-4 and identify the sore spots. I’ve had been tasked with testing the data in both UAT and Prod environments due to data availability delays and quality issues.
2.	Have identified issues with Days Past due calculation, Usage of Loan amount v/s Total Past Due, Multiple lines of entries(>4) against same account where max numbers should be 4. Through my research efforts and insights gained from data analysis, I’ve played a pivotal role in shaping and refining project requirements. This process required a keen eye for detail, analytical acumen and a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape. By keenly analyzing data, I’ve identified crucial patterns, foreseeing potential issues. This proactive approach has contributed to a more streamlined project execution, reducing the risk of future complications.
3.	Through my dedicated contributions and inquisitive approach, I’ve played a pivotal role in refining requirements. Continually seeking clarity and deeper understanding, my thoughtful inquires prompted a more comprehensive exploration of project needs. By actively engaging in discussions, proposing insights, and asking pertinent questions, I feel I’ve influenced the process, ensuring that the project’s requirements were meticulously examined, refined, and aligned with our objectives. This collaborative effort led to a more precise and effective framework, significantly enhancing the project's overall success and alignment with business objectives.
4.	In a collaborative effort with Raisy(Risk) & Brian(Controls), I’ve engaged in the development of a Pay-in-4 Email-Collections project. This encompassed not only the coding aspect but also involved aligning interpretations of the BRD with each member individually to ensure the code's strict compliance with all regulations and policies.
5.	I’ve enhanced the business's progress reporting by implementing a method of breaking down our primary goal into smaller, more manageable objectives. This approach not only provided a clear roadmap for achieving our targets but also enabled more granular tracking and evaluation of our advancements. Through this strategic breakdown, we created a structured framework that allowed for more detailed and transparent reporting, giving stakeholders a clearer view of our progress at various stages. This method fostered a more agile and responsive approach, ensuring a more effective and informed decision-making process within the organization.
6.	Throughout the year, I’ve successfully completed a diverse set of requirements for the business via 59 requests raised directly by them or on their behalf. This included 7 Ad hoc requests raised to provide a specific set of one time data dump. Since a few of them seemed to occur frequently, thanks to my recommendation, the team made the strategic choice to modify one of the reports to address forthcoming issues more rapidly. Additionally, as SPOC for Indian BAR team I played a key role in the migration of 30+ reports to a new database by engaging other team members and was able to guide and solve issues which occurred during migration, ensuring a seamless transition and enhanced data integrity.
7.	I’ve on-boarded 16 inventories/reports inherited from another analyst to the BAR Team standards, identified and decommissioned 10 inventories, Combined 2 reports into 1 adhering to governance norms, Several changes were made to the remaining inventories to enhance their efficiency and usability for the team. One of the major changes was to remove the database dependencies of end user and transitioning it to excel output to ensure auditory compliance. To ensure  compliance to Separation of duties, reports were migrated from existing FID(chnlmgr) to BAR Team FID(SVCBPA). This provided a more streamlined process for execution and tracking of failures.

In this role, I’m not only conceptualizing and providing ideas but also actively transforming these concepts into visual representations, making complex ideas more accessible. By effectively utilizing these skills, I am trying to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and actionable plans, ensuring alignment with management's goals.
